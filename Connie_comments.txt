    This semester in Advanced Programming in Python, we covered the topics of the usage of string, list, tuple, dictionary. We have also practiced how to define and apply functions to code. In addition to daily homework and problem sets, we had an in-class test, a cumulative final exam, and three partner projects to demonstrate learning. A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable code when necessary as well as clearly communicate their understanding of programming concepts.
    You are a curious student. You showed up to 80% of class! You come to see me outside of class for extra help and ask additional questions that demonstrate your strong curiosity towards computer science.
    Connie, some of the questions may be difficult to you, but you manage to explore and try out solutions. You have received Câ€™s on all tests, including a 74% of your cumulative final exam. You have demonstrated strong performace in the following learning outcomes:  Understand and be able to use a variety of data types, control structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques in their programming. Identify and repair coding errors in a program. In the following semester, you can improve on the following learning outcome(s): Design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems. Effectively communicate programming solutions to others. work collaboratively to write modular code on larger projects.
    Connie, you have earned an C for the semester and I look forward to working with you for the remainder of the year.
