    This semester in Advanced Programming in Python, we covered the topics of the usage of string, list, tuple, dictionary. We have also practiced how to define and apply functions to code. In addition to daily homework and problem sets, we had an in-class test, a cumulative final exam, and three partner projects to demonstrate learning. A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable code when necessary as well as clearly communicate their understanding of programming concepts.
    You are perseverant and humorous during class. You showed up to 100% of class! When faced with challenges, you persevere and work your way through even the knottiest of problems through using your peers, teachers, or even google.You add a layer of humour to our material that is appreciated by all.
    Sandy, you occasionally run into coding errors in exams. You have received Bâ€™s on all tests, including a 89% of your cumulative final exam. You have demonstrated strong performace in the following learning outcomes:  Design, document, implement and test solutions to programming problems. Express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts. In the following semester, you can improve on the following learning outcome(s): Identify and repair coding errors in a program. Effectively communicate programming solutions to others.
    Sandy, you have earned an B for the semester and I look forward to working with you for the remainder of the year.
