    This semester in Advanced Programming in Python, we covered the topics of the usage of string, list, tuple, dictionary. We have also practiced how to define and apply functions to code. In addition to daily homework and problem sets, we had an in-class test, a cumulative final exam, and three partner projects to demonstrate learning. A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable code when necessary as well as clearly communicate their understanding of programming concepts.
    You are stellar hard-working, curious, and engaging student during class. You showed up to 100% of class! You faithfully complete the nightly homework and are fully engaged in class discussions.You come to see me outside of class for extra help and ask additional questions that demonstrate your strong curiosity towards computer science.You bring a interesting and relevent questions to class and stay on topic during class. You are active in your learning process and love to engage in the material.
    Sasha, your performance in the course this semester has been phenomenal. You have received Aâ€™s on all tests, including a 99% of your cumulative final exam. You have demonstrated strong performace in the following learning outcomes:  Identify/characterize/define a programming problem. Identify and repair coding errors in a program. Effectively communicate programming solutions to others. In the following semester, you can improve on the following learning outcome(s): Understand and be able to use a variety of data types, control structures, and algorithmic problem-solving techniques in their programming. Express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts.
    Sasha, you have earned an A for the semester and I look forward to working with you for the remainder of the year.
