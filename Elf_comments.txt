    This semester in Advanced Programming in Python, we covered the topics of the usage of string, list, tuple, dictionary. We have also practiced how to define and apply functions to code. In addition to daily homework and problem sets, we had an in-class test, a cumulative final exam, and three partner projects to demonstrate learning. A successful student will be able to develop efficient, readable code when necessary as well as clearly communicate their understanding of programming concepts.
    You are stellar perseverant, collaborative, and hard-working student during class. You showed up to 100% of class! When faced with challenges, you persevere and work your way through even the knottiest of problems through using your peers, teachers, or even google.You are really comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussion and you work well in small groups with your peers.You faithfully complete the nightly homework and are fully engaged in class discussions.
    Elf, your performance in the course this semester has been phenomenal. You have received Aâ€™s on all tests, including a 94% of your cumulative final exam. You have demonstrated strong performace in the following learning outcomes:  Express creativity using coding and technology in a variety of contexts. work collaboratively to write modular code on larger projects. In the following semester, you can improve on the following learning outcome(s): Identify/characterize/define a programming problem.
    Elf, you have earned an A for the semester and I look forward to working with you for the remainder of the year.
